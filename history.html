        <h1>HISTORY OF NOVALICHES</h1>
        <p>Novaliches, now part of Quezon City, has a long and fascinating history that traces its roots back to Spanish colonial times. Originally, Novaliches was a small settlement under the jurisdiction of Caloocan but later became a part of Quezon City in the 1940s when it was restructured into the modern metropolis we know today.</p>

        <p>The name Novaliches is believed to have been derived from the Spanish word "nueva" (new) and "lechia" (a variant of "lacia" meaning land), reflecting the area’s new agricultural settlements during the Spanish era. Novaliches was known as an agricultural hub, with vast areas of rice fields, vegetable gardens, and fruit orchards that sustained the local economy and supported nearby areas, especially in the early 20th century.</p>

	<P>The town of Novaliches played a significant role in the Philippine Revolution in the late 1800s. It became a site for skirmishes between Filipino revolutionary forces and Spanish troops. After the Philippine-American War, Novaliches continued to develop as part of the larger Quezon City area.</P>

	<P>In 1948, the Barangay Novaliches was officially established, and in the 1970s, significant urbanization began as part of the growth of Quezon City, especially with the development of major highways such as the Quirino Highway. The rapid urbanization continued, and by the 2000s, Novaliches became one of the most populous and vibrant parts of Quezon City.</p>

Its residential areas are home to a diverse community, ranging from traditional Filipino families to young professionals and retirees. The development of shopping malls, business centers, and government offices in the area has contributed to the city's growing commercial importance.</p>

	<p>Novaliches is also known for its educational institutions, such as the University of the Philippines – Diliman, which is nearby, and its healthcare services provided by local hospitals and clinics.</P>
	<p>The growth of residential subdivisions and business establishments has made Novaliches one of the most dynamic parts of Quezon City. SM City Novaliches is a major commercial center, providing shopping, dining, and entertainment options for locals and visitors alike.
