            LA MESA ECOPARK
        </a>
    </h1>
        <p><strong>La Mesa Eco Park: A Natural Escape in the Heart of Quezon City</strong></p>
        
        <h2>History of La Mesa Eco Park</h2>
        <p>La Mesa Eco Park is part of the La Mesa Watershed Reservation, a 2,659-hectare protected area in Quezon City that serves as the last remaining rainforest in Metro Manila. The watershed was established in the 1920s as a vital water catchment for the La Mesa Dam, which supplies potable water to millions of residents in Metro Manila.</p>
        
	<p>By the 1990s, rapid urbanization and deforestation posed a significant threat to the watershed, leading to a decline in water quality and loss of forest cover. In response, the ABS-CBN Foundation, in partnership with the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) and the Quezon City Government, launched the Save La Mesa Watershed Project.</p>
        
        <h2>Attractions and Activities</h2>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Environmental Importance</h2>
        <p>La Mesa Eco Park is more than just a recreational site—it plays a crucial role in protecting Metro Manila’s water supply. The reforestation efforts in the watershed help prevent soil erosion, regulate water quality, and maintain biodiversity.</p>
